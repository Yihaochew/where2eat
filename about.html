      <h2>About Our Food Recommendation Website</h2>
  
      <p>Welcome to our food recommendation platform! I'm Yihao, and I created this project as part of the TechUp Programme at Smart Nation Group. This website is designed to help fellow food enthusiasts (like yourself!) discover delicious new dining experiences in Singapore.</p>
  
      <p><strong>The Idea:</strong></p>
      <p>We all get those "What should we eat?" moments. This website aims to take the guesswork out of choosing your next meal. It's designed to provide fun, personalized, and random food suggestions based on your preferences: cuisine type, budget, location, and more.  And the best part? We'll show you exactly where to find these tasty finds on a handy Google Map!</p>
  
      <p><strong>My Approach:</strong></p>
      <p>This project is a learning experience for me, exploring web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The recommendations are currently pre-selected, but I'm excited about the possibilities of integrating user data and real-time restaurant information in the future.</p>
  
      <p><strong>I hope you enjoy using this website as much as I enjoyed building it!</strong> Feel free to explore, get inspired, and maybe even discover your new favorite restaurant. </p>
